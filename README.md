# Brand
The Concord brand is manufactured to look sleek and minimalistic,

We're also keen on keeping things quality.
If you're gonna use the Concord brand somewhere, please keep it tasteful and send it our way for approval.

# Word Mark
The word mark should be the logo shown on banners, embeds, thumbnails, and anything related.

# Mascot
Our mascot is the main part of our 
brand--it represents our "*product*" in a professional and non-inclusive manner.
